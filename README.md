# skittles - GIS Portfolio
I love skittles so that's my GIS Portfolio 90753: Advanced GIS. You can access it [here](https://muhammadasakha.github.io/skittles/).

## About me
<img align="left" src="https://github.com/muhammadasakha/skittles/blob/master/images/IMG_20181226_132106.jpg"> Well I am flattered you are even here. <br/>

So this is Muhammad Sakha and I'm a Fulbright Scholar (final year) at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to CMU, I've worked in portolio management and project financing in Pakistan. <br/>

I mangaged primarily gratuity funds for our instituitional clients and raised debt funds through structured financing deals. Some of the work I've done would be struturing First Pakistan Microfinance Fund a _PKR 5B (US$36M)_ financing facility and managed gratuity funds amounting to PKR 4B ($25M). <br/>

As of late my interest has been more towards data analytics, so I worked on building [biodiversity maps](https://www.unbiodiversitylab.org/) for United Nations for COP25 summit and social media analytics for Sony PlayStation. <br/>

I enjoy travelling (12 countries so far), playing football (soccer) and drawing amateur hand animation (not good).

## What I expect to learn
My focus would be on larning open source tools especially QGIS as its geared with python. Further I'd love to use Mapbox as I really liked its visualizations. You can see some of my work at [here](https://www.unbiodiversitylab.org/) where I worked on biodiversity maps for UN COP 25 sumit. 

## Portfolio
Well here goes my portfolio.

### Google Map Style: Kepler Visuals
In this exercise, I used the [Google Maps Platform Styling Wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/) to create my own Google Maps basemap, which I've named Kepler Inspirations. To create the style, I used [Kepler GL](https://kepler.gl/) and [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) visualizations as my inspiration.

I ultimately settled on the following images from Kepler visualizations (photo by [Kepler GL Uber](https://github.com/muhammadasakha/skittles/blob/master/images/image4-3.png?raw=true) via [Kepler GL](https://kepler.gl)). It shows  kepler.gl visualization for elevation contours of San Francisco and Treasure Island/Yerba Island.

Using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image), I created a custom color palette based on the image.

Again using Kepler visualization, I choose this images to get some strong colors for contrast. It shows Bay Area commute patterns.

Again I converted them into a color palette using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image):

In Google Maps Styling Wizard, I selected the "Aubergine" theme to serve as my base template and then changed the colors of various features using the hex codes from my custom color palette. A screenshot of the final product is displayed below. To access an interactive version of the map style, just click [here](https://muhammadasakha.github.io/skittles/MapView.html).

Kepler Polygons

Here is a map of Paycheck Protecton Program (PPP) showing the average loan per 1,000 small businesses overlaid with the commercial bank concentration ratio per 10,000 small businesses. 

See my map [here](https://kepler.gl/demo/map?mapUrl=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/0mxe908d70dui28/keplergl_5gd1yk.json).
