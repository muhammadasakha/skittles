# skittles - GIS Portfolio
I love skittles so that's my GIS Portfolio 90753: Advanced GIS. You can access it [here](https://muhammadasakha.github.io/skittles/).

## About me
<img align="center" src="https://github.com/muhammadasakha/skittles/blob/master/images/IMG_20181226_132106.jpg"> <br/>

Well I am flattered you are even here.

Hi I'm Muhammad Sakha, a Fulbright Scholar (final year) at Carnegie Mellon University. Prior to CMU, I've worked in portfolio management and project financing in Pakistan. <br/>

I managed primarily gratuity funds for our institutional clients and raised debt funds through structured financing deals. Some of the work I've done would be structuring First Pakistan Microfinance Fund a _PKR 5B (US$36M)_ financing facility and managed gratuity funds amounting to PKR 4B ($25M). <br/>

As of late my interest has been more towards data analytics, so I worked on building [biodiversity maps](https://www.unbiodiversitylab.org/) for United Nations for COP25 summit and social media analytics for Sony PlayStation. <br/>

I enjoy travelling (12 countries so far), playing football (soccer) and drawing amateur hand animation (not good).

## What I expect to learn
My focus would be on learning open source tools especially QGIS as its geared with python. Further I'd love to use Mapbox as I really liked its visualizations. You can see some of my work at [here](https://www.unbiodiversitylab.org/) where I worked on biodiversity maps for UN COP 25 summit. 

## Portfolio
Well here goes my portfolio.

### Google Map Style: Kepler Visuals
In this exercise, I used the [Google Maps Platform Styling Wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/) to create my own Google Maps basemap, which I've named Kepler Inspirations. To create the style, I used [Kepler GL](https://kepler.gl/) and [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) visualizations as my inspiration.

I ultimately settled on the following images from Kepler visualizations (photo by [Kepler GL Uber](https://github.com/muhammadasakha/skittles/blob/master/images/image4-3.png?raw=true) via [Kepler GL](https://kepler.gl)). It shows  kepler.gl visualization for elevation contours of San Francisco and Treasure Island/Yerba Island.

Using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image), I created a custom color palette based on the image.

Again using Kepler visualization, I choose this images to get some strong colors for contrast. It shows Bay Area commute patterns.

Again I converted them into a color palette using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image):

In Google Maps Styling Wizard, I selected the "Aubergine" theme to serve as my base template and then changed the colors of various features using the hex codes from my custom color palette. A screenshot of the final product is displayed below. To access an interactive version of the map style, just click [here](https://muhammadasakha.github.io/skittles/MapView.html).

### Visualizing Google Location Data in Kepler GL

I analyzed my location data from Google Maps to see how my mobility has been over the last few years. 

Here is a visualization showing my movement patterns within US.

### Biodiversity Mapping using Satellite Data UNDP - QGIS
This is an ongoing project where I am analyzing biodiversity regions across Latin America using QGIS an opensource tool. I am using satellite imagery and data by Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development.
